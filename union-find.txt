union find  --- connectivity
Basic operations:
union (insert , grow, update, delete), 
find-if-connected ( query)

Basic data-structure:
Set ( of nodes).

1.  the intermediate queue of nodes, can be used to get the path .


Problem model:  node
problem relation:  is-connected-to  relation , between nodes
relation characters:  reflexive, sysmetric, transitive

Data structure:
1. object maps to integers.

2. integers belong to the same set, have the same number as ID


Above is for quick-find. query get response easy/fast


quick-union. how to union 2 sets fast ?

array is used like a list (array is used to represent a forest). 
each points to its parent. 


use , make a balanced tree. 

keep weight , number of the tree node.  so when it is query it is ready.

Weighted-tree-merge

path compression to make the tree height smaller,  occur when try to find root.
